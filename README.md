Dog vs. Cat Image Classification Project
Introduction
This project aims to classify images as either containing a dog or a cat using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The dataset used for training and testing consists of images of dogs and cats obtained from the "Dog vs. Cat" dataset available on Kaggle.

Dataset
The dataset is organized into training and testing sets, each containing images of dogs and cats. The images are stored in separate directories for ease of access.

Tools and Libraries
Python: The primary programming language used for coding the project.
TensorFlow and Keras: Used for building and training the CNN model.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: Utilized for data visualization.
NumPy: Employed for numerical computations.
Other standard Python libraries: Used for general tasks such as file handling and image processing.
Model Architecture
The CNN model is constructed using the Keras Sequential API. It consists of several convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers to extract features from the input images. The final layers include fully connected (dense) layers for classification. The model architecture is summarized as follows:

Input layer: Accepts input images of size 224x224 pixels with 3 color channels (RGB).
Convolutional layers: Four convolutional layers with increasing filter sizes (32, 64, 128, 128) and ReLU activation functions.
Max-pooling layers: Four max-pooling layers to downsample the feature maps.
Flatten layer: Flattens the output from the convolutional layers.
Dense layers: Two fully connected layers with 512 and 1 neurons, respectively, with ReLU and sigmoid activation functions.
Training
The model is trained using the ImageDataGenerator class in Keras, which performs real-time data augmentation during training. The RMSprop optimizer is employed with a learning rate of 1e-3, and the binary cross-entropy loss function is used for optimization. The training process is conducted for 10 epochs with a batch size of 20.

Evaluation
During training, both training and validation accuracy and loss are monitored. After training, the model's performance is evaluated on the test set to assess its ability to generalize to unseen data.

Results
The training and validation accuracy and loss curves are plotted using Matplotlib to visualize the model's learning progress.

Deployment
Once trained, the model is saved as a .h5 file for later use. Additionally, a sample image is loaded and passed through the model for inference, demonstrating how the model predicts whether the image contains a dog or a cat.

Conclusion
This project serves as an example of using CNNs for image classification tasks, specifically for distinguishing between images of dogs and cats. The provided code can be further extended or modified for similar classification tasks involving different categories of images.
